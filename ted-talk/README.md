# TED Talks Segmentation and Topics Extraction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains code for segmenting and extracting topics from TED Talks using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to group TED Talks into clusters based on their content and extract key topics from each cluster.


## Project Overview
TED Talks are a rich source of knowledge across various domains. In this project, we use machine learning techniques to:
- Segment TED Talks into different clusters.
- Extract key topics from each cluster using topic modeling.

The project applies **TF-IDF Vectors** and **Count Vectors** for feature extraction and **K-Means Clustering** for segmentation. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we use the **Elbow Method**. Visualizations, such as **monogram word clouds**, help interpret the topics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:  
[TED Talks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/ted-talks)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- WordCloud
- Streamlit (for UI)

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - **TF-IDF Vectors** and **Count Vectors** are used to convert textual data into numerical form.

3. **Clustering**:
   - **K-Means Clustering** algorithm is used to segment TED Talks into clusters.
   - The **Elbow Method** is applied to identify the optimal number of clusters.

4. **Topic Extraction**:
   - Key topics from each cluster are extracted and analyzed.
   - **Monogram Word Cloud** is used for visualizing prominent words in each cluster.


## Results

The TED Talks dataset was successfully segmented into clusters, and key topics were extracted using machine learning. The clusters and topics are visualized through **monogram word clouds**, providing insights into the dominant themes within each group of talks.
