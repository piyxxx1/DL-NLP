# TED Talks Segmentation and Topics Extraction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on **segmenting TED Talks** and extracting their **topics** using various **Machine Learning techniques**. TED Talks, known for their rich content and diverse subjects, offer an excellent resource for Natural Language Processing tasks such as segmentation and topic modeling. The goal of this project is to analyze TED Talks and categorize them based on their underlying topics.

## Overview
In this project, we aim to:
- Segment TED Talks into meaningful parts.
- Extract and categorize topics using techniques like **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**, **NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)**, or others.
- Analyze the effectiveness of different topic modeling algorithms.

The project uses **Machine Learning** and **NLP** techniques to process the TED Talks dataset, with the goal of better understanding the core ideas behind each talk.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
- [TED Talks Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/ted-talks)

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw dataset needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. Scripts for this are provided.
2. **Topic Modeling**: You can experiment with different topic modeling algorithms such as LDA or NMF.
3. **Segmentation**: TED Talks will be segmented based on defined criteria.
4. **Visualization**: Use the provided scripts to visualize the topics and segmentations.


## Results
After running the project, you will be able to:
- See the segmented parts of each TED Talk.
- Extract the main topics discussed in each segment.
- Visualize the topics using word clouds, bar charts, etc.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Streamlit** (for UI)
- **LDA**, **NMF**, and other topic modeling techniques
- **Scikit-learn**, **NLTK**, **Gensim**, etc.
